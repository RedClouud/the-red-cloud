# The Red Cloud

The Red Cloud is where I store all of the files required to run my own firewall.

## Get started

The following command will install all required dependencies then setup and run the server.

```bash
sudo apt-get install curl \
&& source <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedClouud/the-red-cloud/automate-deployment/start-all.sh)
```

# TODO:

- Make the get started command one line
